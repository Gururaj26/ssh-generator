# SSH Generator

Simple tool to generate ssh keys. Every time when i used to create ssh keys it generally took at least 10mins as a beginner. It will not take more than 2mins to create your ssh keys using this.

## Usage

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```
npm install -g ssh-generator
```

### Create your ssh keys

```
ssh-generator
```

Select one of the three big git services for which you want to create your keys for. Or select custom to create keys for custom domains.


## Why ?

As mentioned above it generally took at least 10-15mins for me to create those keys and get them up and running. Post searching for the steps again and again. This shouldn't take more than a minute to create your ssh keys.

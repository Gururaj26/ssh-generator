# SSH Generator

Simple tool to generate ssh keys. Every time when i used to create ssh keys it generally took at least 10mins as a beginner. It will not take more than 2mins to create your ssh keys using this.

### Create your ssh keys with SSH Generator

Select one of the three big git services for which you want to create your keys for. Or select custom to create keys for custom domains.


## Why ?

As mentioned above it generally took at least 10-15mins for me to create those keys and get them up and running. Post searching for the steps again and again. This shouldn't take more than a minute to create your ssh keys.
